# PISCOt (Tmin)

The downscaled version of PISCOt v1.1, gridded maximum/minimun temperature has been created using GWR (plus bilinear interpolation) using land surface temperature and elevation at 0.01Â° (~1 km) in a climatologically aided process (similar to the climatologically aided interpolation). The detailed repository is located on <https://github.com/adrHuerta/PISCOt_spatial_downscaling>
