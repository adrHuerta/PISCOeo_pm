# Monthly2Daily - monthly to daily homogenization factors
# monthly_ts: Original monthly time serie
# monthly_ts_hmg: Homogenized monthly time serie
# daily_ts: Original daily time serie
# period_ts: Period time to interpolate monthly to daily values

# Note:
# Each monthly factor is assumed to be located at the 15th day of each month
# the rest of values are obtained using 1D linear interpolation
# finally, these values are added to the daily_ts to get a daily homogenized serie
# similar to the approach in https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/15/11/1520-0442_2002_015_1322_hodtoc_2.0.co_2.xml
