# spt_neighrs - Seek of neighbouring stations
# id_station : ID of station data
# stations_database: a dataframe with LON and LAT information (it also needs to have a ID columns)
# lmt_dist : distance (in km) in which a station is declared as a neighbouring station
# lmt_elv : elevation (in m) limit in which a station is declared as a neighbouring station
# lmt_n : number of maximum neighbouring stations

# Note:
# Defined values based on analysis of correlation vs distance vs elevation
# i) neighbouring stations are filtered using given limits
# ii) sort distance (method = "euclidean") in 3D distance (lat, lon, elev)
